#	~/.config/mc/filehighlight.ini	(user configuration)
#
# The purpose of this file is to match dircolors filetypes, so dicolors colors
# can be applied in MC skins (cyanellow skins provide such matching theme)

# RULES:
# 1. The _default_ color pair in the [core] section of the selected skin is
#    automatically applied to both:
#    - what is not defined here in the appropriate [section]
#    - what is not set in the [filehighlight] section of the selected skin
# 2. Section names are free and not predefined for this file; you can add
#    whatever you want.
# 3. What is defined before takes precedence over what is defined after. That
#    means subtypes MUST BE DEFINED BEFORE their main type to be taken into
#    account.

# This is a subtype of DEVICE
[block]
    type=DEVICE_BLOCK

# This is a subtype of DEVICE
[character]
    type=DEVICE_CHAR

# This is a main type; it applies to all devices that are not defined
# before by a subtype (DEVICE_BLOCK or DEVICE_CHAR)
[device]
    type=DEVICE

# This is a subtype of SPECIAL
[fifo]
    type=SPECIAL_FIFO

# This is a subtype of SPECIAL
[door]
    type=SPECIAL_DOOR

# This is a subtype of SPECIAL
[socket]
    type=SPECIAL_SOCKET

# This is a main type; it applies to all special files that are not defined
# before by a subtype (SPECIAL_FIFO, SPECIAL_DOOR or SPECIAL_SOCKET)
[special]
    type=SPECIAL

# This is a subtype of DIR
[linkdir]
    type=LINK_DIR

# This is a main type; it applies to all directories that are not defined
# before by a subtype (LINK_DIR)
[directory]
    type=DIR

# This is a main type with no subtype
[stalelink]
    type=STALE_LINK

# This is a subtype of LINK
[symlink]
    type=SYMLINK

# This is a subtype of LINK
#[hardlink]
#    type=HARDLINK

# This is a main type; it applies to all links that are not defined
# before by a subtype (SYMLINK or HARDLINK). Note that LINK_DIR and
# STALE_LINK are not subtypes of LINK.
#[link]
#    type=LINK

# This is a subtype of FILE
[executable]
    type=FILE_EXE

# Non-executable files, sorted by their names (extension is a part of the name)
#
# So, a new section [audio] has been added; [archive] and [media] contents
# have been modified; other sections have been kept for compatibility with
# other skins than the cyanellow one.

# This is a main type. It catches all files that are not defined before by
# their subtype (FILE_EXE) or name (regexp or extension). Defining the FILE
# type here and into the [filehighlight] section of the selected skin allows
# to show them with a proper color (instead of the _default_ color of the
# [core] section). So it is possible to have colored frames with lightgray
# or white filenames.
